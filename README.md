# Scala: IllegalArgumentException on Negative Age Assignment

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Scala class related to age validation.  The `MyClass` attempts to prevent negative ages, but throws an exception instead of handling it more gracefully. 

The code example shows how the `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when a negative value is assigned to the `age` property.
